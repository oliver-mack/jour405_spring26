title: "UMD Fees"

Follow along with the demo to learn how to calculate percentage change using R and the Tidyverse. You should get started by loading the tidyverse in a new R block.


### Task 1: Load the tidyverse


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```




### Task 2: Load the UMD Fees dataset from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/umd_fees.csv

```{r}
umd_fees <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/umd_fees.csv")
```

### Task 3: Calculate the percentage change in each category between Fall 2024 and Fall 2021 using `mutate()`

```{r}
umd_fees_pct <- umd_fees |> mutate(pct_change = (`Fall 2024`- `Fall 2021`)/`Fall 2021` * 100)
```


```{r}
umd_fees_pct_2524 <- umd_fees |> mutate(pct_change = (`Fall 2025`- `Fall 2024`)/`Fall 2024` * 100)
```



### Task 4: Describe our results

Write a few sentences about what you found in the data. What's the story here?

There's been a 4.5% increase in the amount of student fees at UMD from 2024 to 2025. Student fees have increased every year since at least 2021. This could be an interesting story looking into why these fees are increasing at such a significant rate each year and whether or not this money is actually being used effectively.

```{r}
comp <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/class_composition.csv")

comp |>
  summarize(
    mean_first = mean(first_year),
    mean_soph = mean(sophomore),
    mean_junior = mean(junior),
    mean_senior = mean(senior),
    mean_grad = mean(grad)
  )
```




When you are done, save your work, switch to GitHub Desktop, then add, commit and push your changes to GitHub and submit the URL of the notebook in ELMS.
